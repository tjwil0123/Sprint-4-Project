This application is built on an exploratory analysis and visualization of a dataset of vehicles. One visualization is a scatterplot showing the relation between odometer value and price, with a checkbox allowing vehicle condition to be seen as well. The second is a histogram showing the distribution of conditions.

If you would like to test this application on your own machine, simply clone the repo and run 'streamlit run app.py' on your terminal.
